# Osu-Map-Grabber
Copies songs and backgrounds from your osu folder, and processes them to into a music playlist when provided a source and destination

# Install
`git clone https://github.com/klayza/Osu-Map-Grabber`

# Run
`python SongRenamer.py`<br />
Mind the indicator folder, it's just used to track the last time you ran this program

# Help
If there are problems, just delete the destination folder and try again ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

# Todo<br />
- Change Artist tags using their title<br />
- (Maybe) Have songs copied to phone with control <br />
- Store a config or json file that can store the source and destination<br />
- Change logic to only take the largest image in a folder (background image) and delete the rest of the junk files<br />
